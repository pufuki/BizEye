# BizEye — AI-Powered Business Intelligence for D2C Brands

> Transform raw business data into actionable intelligence — performance, sentiment, and predictions from one unified dashboard.

BizEye is a front-end prototype of an AI-powered business intelligence platform designed for small and growing direct-to-consumer (D2C) brands. It provides a clean, modern interface for visualizing sales performance, understanding customer sentiment, and acting on AI-generated forecasts — all without requiring a data science team.

## Overview

Small D2C brands often lack the resources to build dedicated analytics infrastructure. BizEye bridges that gap by providing an intuitive dashboard that surfaces the three pillars of business intelligence:

1. **Performance** — Which products are winning, which are declining, and where revenue is concentrated.
2. **Sentiment** — What customers are saying, how they feel, and which themes drive satisfaction or frustration.
3. **Predictive** — What will sell out, which customers are at risk of churning, and what demand looks like next month.

This repository contains the front-end prototype with dummy data, dummy authentication, and a fully interactive UI suitable for stakeholder demos and design validation.

## Features

### Landing Page

- Dark, modern hero section with animated entrance effects
- Floating business-themed background icons (charts, dollar signs, carts, rockets, and more) with aquarium-style swimming animation
- Three-pillar feature showcase (Performance, Sentiment, Predictive)
- Key statistics bar
- Audience segmentation section
- Call-to-action with dashboard launch

### Authentication

- Split-screen sign-in / sign-up page
- Clean form design with icon-led inputs
- Toggle between sign-in and sign-up modes
- Form validation with inline error messaging
- Loading state on submit
- Dummy authentication — any email and password (4+ characters) grants access

### Dashboard

- Persistent dark sidebar with navigation, upload CTA, and AI assistant card
- Sticky top bar with search, notifications, and user profile
- Four fully-built dashboard sections (see below)
- Responsive layout — sidebar collapses to an overlay on mobile

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or higher
- npm 9 or higher

### Installation

```bash
npm install
```

The development server starts automatically in this environment. If running locally outside this environment:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

     │                 │
     └── "Get Started"  └── Dummy auth (any email + 4+ char password)
```

The app uses simple state-based routing in `App.tsx` — no router library is needed for this prototype. The `Page` type (`'landing' | 'login' | 'dashboard'`) controls which screen is rendered.
